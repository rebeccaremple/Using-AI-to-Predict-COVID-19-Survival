# Using-AI-to-Predict-COVID-19-Survival
I built a binary classification model in Python that, based on clinical data, predicts whether a person will recover from COVID-19 with 90% accuracy. I also used Shapley values and surrogate decision trees to show which factors contribute most to COVID-19 mortality.  This was my final project for my AI/ML course with UCLA Extension.
